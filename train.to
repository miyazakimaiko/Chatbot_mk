This is my point exactly.  Even though some languages are completely different, once you learn one the transition to others isn't that difficult.  Most programmers will naturally transition between languages out of curiosity, but you have to start somewhere.  That somewhere doesn't matter.

What about large November elections where there are tons of local positions and the like on the ballot? I'm honestly wondering. I'm not totally averse to the idea, I just think the idea of a 'test' for people to vote could be a bit much.

You apparently don't understand the distinction between process and die size.  xxnm means that the transistor gates are each ~xx nanometers wide.  Die size is how much area of a silicon wafer gets used to make each chip.

Oh, thanks.  Didn't see that before.
Perhaps those image boards have a macro that replace 'girl' with 'cum dumpster', and so the anonymous people there aren't really calling her mean names, but it's the macro which makes it look that way.

You must know some pretty loose women.
With the added bonus of being in Iowa - so marriage is an option if it gets serious.

I love that the guy commenting was named Borg.
Wonder it's so good that you remember the joke still.
I'm not sure if the chaos caused by Hitler's genocide, specifically referring to the push for a Jewish state in the mid-east, is still less the Lenin's killings. 
You know what dude...if you're enjoying getting primped I say go for it.  Put on a show.  If she likes you it will be awesome and if she doesnt it wont matter either way.  Good on you.

Along these lines, I'll add 'Death Is the Road to Awe' from The Fountain OST.  Composed by Clint Mansell (the guy who did the music from Requiem for a Dream that's used so often), and performed by Mogwai and Kronos Quartet.

That picture always reminded me of Andross from Star Fox. 
Quite like, I'd hope.  Their 'GHOSTS' ep was a masterpiece of 'album making' (if that's a term?).  Great music, consistent in theme and suggesting a narrative, and all bound up in some phenomenal packaging.
Seems like a nice project for getting to know QT's Canvas. Should be really simple to do too. I guess some UI-designers would run away screaming by now.
You are being harmed because you can't put your money under your mattress and have it retain value.  You MUST participate in the banking system.

It's not an issue for them at least. They can easily build desalinization plants with all the cash they have on hand and power them with their oil. They will also keep the water costs low by subsidizing the water (got to keep the peasants happy with the monarchy!)
